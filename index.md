## Short Presentation

Hello, my name is Mylène Campana. I'm a French woman specialized in Robotics and Computer Sciences.

I am currently finishing my PhD in Robotics in the [GEPETTO team](http://projects.laas.fr/gepetto/index.php) of LAAS-CNRS, under the supervision of Jean-Paul Laumond. I am also attached to the Université Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III), Toulouse, France.

I will be looking for a job from October 2017 in any country, preferentially a post-doc.

## Biography
I graduated in Mechatronics at [ENS Rennes](http://www.mecatronique.ens-rennes.fr) in 2013. I also completed two interships: one in [Aldebaran Robotics](http://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com), a French Robotics company, and one in the Virtual Reality Application Center [VRAC](http://www.vrac.iastate.edu), an American laboratory.

Then, I followed the research [Master](http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/masters/master-robotique-decision-et-commande-664393.kjsp?RH=1454074064222) "Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition and Robotics" at the University Paul Sabatier (Toulouse) in 2013-2014. I completed the Master with an internship in the Gepetto team where I discovered motion planning. My PhD started in September 2014.

## Research interests
My PhD thesis is about "Motion Planning for Digital Actors". I focus on designing and implementing new algorithms in the Humanoid-Path-Planner software. I also conceive benchmarks to test the algorithms, including new characters and environments made with the Blender software.
For instance, a simple path-optimizer that shortens solution-paths obtained by probabilistic planners has been created and tested in various environments. I am also interested in planning jumping motions for characters in arbitrary 3D environments, under constraints such as non-slippage and velocity limitations. The resulting motions are closed to current computer animation themes of study.
For more information about these works, you can find my publications [here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/search/index/q/*/authIdHal_s/mylene-campana) (freely available in PDF).

However, my research interests are not limited to my PhD subject, I am also paying attention to:

- artificial intelligence and machine learning
- robotics and ethics
- computer animation

## Teaching
In the continuity of achieving the [Agrégation SII](http://www.devenirenseignant.gouv.fr/cid98734/les-epreuves-de-l-agregation-externe-section-sciences-industrielles-de-l-ingenieur.html) teacher contest in Industrial Sciences for the Engineer in 2013, I started to teach during my PhD. 
I give practical classes at the Université Paul Sabatier, at Bachelor and Master levels (niveaux L3-M1-M2). These exercises are about robotics bases, robotics command with ROS, robotics simulation with Matlab and basic C programming.
