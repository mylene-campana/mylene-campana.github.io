## Short Presentation

Hello, my name is Mylène Campana. I'm a French woman specialized in computer science, robotics and computer animation.

I am currently working on robotics & animation in the [Gepetto team](http://projects.laas.fr/gepetto/index.php) of the LAAS-CNRS Toulouse, France, under the supervision of Jean-Paul Laumond.
I defended my PhD thesis on _Motion planning for digital actors_ on the 7th of July 2017.

I will be looking for a job from January 2018 in the USA or in the Canada, preferentially a post-doc position in robotics or computer animation.

## Research interests
**Keywords: motion planning, computer animation, jumping motion, path optimization, simulation**

During my thesis, I focused on designing and implementing new algorithms in the [Humanoid-Path-Planner library](http://humanoid-path-planner.github.io/hpp-doc/index.html) (HPP). I also conceived benchmarks to test the algorithms, including new characters and environments made with the Blender software.
For instance, we developed a gradient-based path-optimizer that shortens solution-paths obtained by probabilistic planners. The optimizer has been tested in various environments and compared to other existing methods.

I was also interested in planning jumping motions for characters in arbitrary 3D environments, under physics-inspired constraints such as non-slippage and velocity limitations. The rendering of HPP planned paths is improved using Blender rigging tool and personal code. Thus the resulting motions are close to current computer animation themes of study.

For more information about these works, you can find my publications below.

However, my research interests are not limited to my PhD subject, I am also paying attention to:

- artificial intelligence and machine learning
- robotics and ethics
- human-robot interaction
- computer animation

## Teaching
In the continuity of achieving the [Agrégation SII](http://www.devenirenseignant.gouv.fr/cid98734/les-epreuves-de-l-agregation-externe-section-sciences-industrielles-de-l-ingenieur.html) teacher contest in Industrial Sciences for the Engineer in 2013, I teached during my PhD (192 hours). 
I gave practical classes at the Université Paul Sabatier, at Bachelor and Master levels (niveaux L3-M1-M2). These exercises were about robotics bases, robotics command with ROS, robotics simulation with Matlab and C-Matlab programming.

## Biography
I graduated in Mechatronics at [ENS Rennes](http://www.mecatronique.ens-rennes.fr) in 2013. I also completed two interships: one at [Aldebaran Robotics](http://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com), a French Robotics company, and one at the Virtual Reality Application Center [VRAC](http://www.vrac.iastate.edu), an American laboratory of the Iowa State.

Then, I followed the research [Master](http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/masters/master-robotique-decision-et-commande-664393.kjsp?RH=1454074064222) "Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition and Robotics" at the University Paul Sabatier (Toulouse) in 2013-2014. I completed the Master with an internship in the Gepetto team where I discovered motion planning. My PhD started in September 2014 and finished in August 2017, and was funded by the French national grant _CDSN_ provided by the ENS Rennes.
